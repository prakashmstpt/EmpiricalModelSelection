  
In conclusion, it is necessary to assess whether the chosen model is optimal for the task and has undergone fine-tuning. Compare its performance to that of a custom model and consider the trade-off between engineering complexity and ease of maintenance. Evaluate the significance of inference response time and establish a clear model life cycle strategy. These elements play a critical role in making the correct decision for selecting the appropriate model.
